# Artificial Images: RunwayML & Google Colab
Taught by [Derrick Schultz](https://twitter.com/dvsch?lang=en) and [Lia Coleman](https://twitter.com/Lialialiacole).

[Artificial Images: RunwayML & Google Colab](https://www.bustbright.com/product/runwayml-google-colab-course-starting-february-24th-2021/317) is a course for image makers (graphic designers, artists, illustrators and photographers) to learn about the basics of generative machine learning using RunwayML and Google Colab.
In this class you’ll use popular deep learning models to create images, videos, and interactive experiences. The focus will be on hands-on experimentation with style transfer, CycleGAN/Pix2Pix, and StyleGAN2-ADA in RunwayML and Google Colab. The course will cover the theory behind deep learning and GANs, using pre-trained models, dataset creation, and training custom models. We’ll look at ways to generate images and videos using Python, p5.js, as well as reacting to sound and motion inputs. While you don’t need to have any coding experience, its probably helpful to have some awareness of coding principles. All notebooks will be provided to you so any modifications will be minor.

# Class Logistics
RunwayML + Google Colab will meet live for 10 weeks (8 weeks of lectures, 2 weeks of heads down time) on Wednesdays at 7:30pm EST starting on February 24. You should be able to attend every session via Zoom, so please make sure your schedule allows for it. In addition to the eight 1.5-hour sessions, there will be two open 1hr sessions with Lia and Derrick every week to answer questions and get help on projects. Additionally, you will have the option of a 20-minute 1-on-1 session with the instructors to get help with a specific project you are working on (to be scheduled individually). We will be using Slack for asynchronous messaging and discussion. Additional materials outside of the lectures and demos will be provided as video links, webpages or PDFs.

### Homework
1. Explore the pre-trained models in Runway. [Playlist of demos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWuCzxqIpJs8OOUUePUNVCHrCGDoKTtyn). Find a model to explore. In the class Slack tell us the following:
- What model you used
- What the inputs and outputs were
- What questions you have about the model
- Show us what you made.

Do this for at least three models.
